                <p class="card-text">I was born in Kansas City,Misouri. When I was nine years old, my family moved to Florida.
                    I attended elementary, Middle School,and High School there. After graduating high school, I joined the
                    US Army. After basic training, I was stationed at Fort Bragg,NC and was eventully sent to Germany. After
                    my enlistment, I started college, and also joined the US Army reserve. My unit was even called up to
                    Desert Storm/Desert Shield. I eventually, finished out my 20 year in 2000.</p>
                <p class="card-text">I attended college at the University of North Floria, graduating in 1990. I worked for
                    a defense contractor in Florida, before moving to Kansas to work for BNSF railway. I got married in 2005,
                    and have worked for a couple of defense contractors as a E-Learning Developer.</p>
                <p class="card-text"> Most recently the City of Shawnee,Kansas as a IT Web Developer Intern. The reason I
                    am attending this bootcamp is to become a full-stack web developer. I hope to learn alot about web development
                    including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, among others, and now the journey begins.</p>
