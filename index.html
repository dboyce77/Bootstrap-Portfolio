                    <!-- <h2>The Greatest Website Ever Made</h2> -->
                    <p>Here's a short bio of my background. If you need more information go to my website at:
                        <a href="http://www.douglas-boyce.com">Douglas Boyce Web Site</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>I was born in Kansas City,Misouri. When I was nine years old, my family moved to Florida. I attended
                        elementary, Middle School,and High School there. After graduating high school, I joined the US Army.
                        After basic training, I was stationed at Fort Bragg,NC and was eventully sent to Germany. After my
                        enlistment, I started college, and also joined the US Army reserve. My unit was even called up to
                        Desert Storm/Desert Shield. I eventually, finished out my 20 year in 2000.
                    </p>

                    <p> I attended college at the University of North Floria, graduating in 1990. I worked for a defense contractor
                        in Florida, before moving to Kansas to work for BNSF railway. I got married in 2005, and have worked
                        for a couple of defense contractors as a E-Learning Developer.
                    </p>

                    <p> Most recently the City of Shawnee,Kansas as a IT Web Developer Intern. The reason I am attending this
                        bootcamp is to become a full-stack web developer. I hope to learn alot about web development including
                        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, among others, and now the journey begins.</p>
